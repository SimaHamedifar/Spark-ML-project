# Spark-ML-project

This project was created as part of the IBM Machine Learning with Apache Spark course and demonstrates Spark-based ETL, data analysis, and ML pipeline training using PySpark.

All code is original, developed for learning and demonstration purposes only.

## Scenario

You are a data engineer at an aeronautics consulting company. Your company prides itself in being able to efficiently design airfoils for use in planes and sports cars. Data scientists in your office need to work with different algorithms and data in different formats. While they are good at Machine Learning, they count on you to be able to do ETL jobs and build ML pipelines. In this project you will use the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. You will clean this dataset, by dropping the duplicate rows, and removing the rows with null values. You will create an ML pipe line to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on all the other columns. You will evaluate the model and towards the end you will persist the model.
